Introduction
This case study details the research and development process that led to the creation of a landing page for a wholesale clothing store targeting resellers and retailers.
The goal was to validate the feasibility of a landing page as a tool to attract, engage, and convert B2B (business-to-business) clients in the wholesale fashion industry.

Discovery
Context
The wholesale clothing market in Ceará is highly competitive. Small and medium-sized retailers, who represent a significant portion of wholesale buyers, often struggle to find reliable suppliers offering high-quality products,
competitive prices, and streamlined purchasing processes.
The idea for the landing page emerged from identifying an opportunity: to provide a digital platform that centralizes information about collections, prices, and purchasing terms, optimizing the time and experience of clients.

Challenge
The main challenge was to validate whether a landing page could:
Increase brand visibility in the B2B market.
Simplify the purchasing decision process for retailers.
Generate qualified leads for the sales team.
Compete with established players, such as wholesale trade shows and B2B marketplaces.
Methodologies Used
To ensure a robust study, we combined qualitative and quantitative approaches to understand the market, target audience, and best practices for the landing page.
Qualitative and Quantitative Research
In-depth Interviews: Five interviews were conducted with small and medium-sized retailers in Fortaleza, Maracanaú, and surrounding areas.
The interviews explored challenges faced in wholesale purchasing, preferences for purchasing channels, and expectations for digital platforms.
